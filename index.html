<h2 align="center">About myself</h2>
<hr color="black" width="20%">
<p align="justify">My name is Ky Anh, first year students of RMIT, I am a talkative person and generous one. I come to RMIT not just to study but also making friends to. I have an intense interest in technology and information since I was small, so I choose IT as my major. Furthermore, I like to work in groups rather than working by myself, this resulted in when I working alone, my brain cannot process the information and ideas of my, but by working in groups I have chance to express my ideas and also sharing it with the others. Nevertheless, although I am just step by step in learning how to code but I practice it every day, I also I sometimes get distracted by games on my computer screen.</p>
<hr color="black" width="50%">
<h2 align="center">Interest in IT</h2>
<hr color="black" width="20%">
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
    <li>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</li>
    <p align="justify">For Information Technology, things that I interest in most is the data, the reason is I want to know how those enormous amounts of data been manipulated and composed for the user to read.<br>
When I was at the age of 8 is very different, the first time I have attracted to IT was when I got a Nintendo DS from my father. The moment I use it is when I first interact with IT, everything was new and strange, back then I used to picking up cheat code from the file of the game card and applied it to every single game I like. Then by the time passed by, I get addicted to it, getting my eyes at the black screen full of codes makes me happy.<br>
For me, the person who makes me interest in IT is my father and I do not regret my decision.<br>
I have only one IT experience which is an IT event held at my secondary school, this just an in-class competition but for me it was a huge one. Each students in my class have to code a huge formula and make it print out the answer using Turbo Pascal which is very challenging, but I still completed it in the last second.
</p>
    <li>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</li>
    <p align="justify">I come to RMIT not because of the fame but also the knowledge they provide for the students who come to study. Unlike other school, the reason I choose to learn IT at RMIT is because they provide for students both theory and practice so the students can acquire more knowledge and enhance their skill. RMIT also giving students a chance to become an internship in some large company in the future while learning. This will help students horned their skills more and learn from potential people in some area.
</p>
    <li>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</li>
    <p>Although there is nothing I would like to express, but I want to practice more at coding skill. I’m usually visit some IT forum to learn more about coding skill and types, therefore all I notice is that the way I learn how to code is different from others people form every IT forum and it really difficult for me to strengthen my skill.</p>

<p align="justify">For my ideal job, I would like to apply for Developer position of Shinhan DS Vietnam Company. This position is really suit for me because it requires number of commons programming languages such as Java, HTML, CSS and more that I have learned so far.</p><p>As to apply for this job, my major must be Information Technology, Computer Science, Software Engineering, or other related fields. Furthermore, you must have experiences with some database such as MySQL or Oracle Database. Nevertheless, experiences with some programming languages such as Java, HTML, CSS, Jquery & AJAX, ExtJS or some operating system such as Linux or Window Server. However, you must participate with these things for 5 years or more to apply for the job. Besides providing IT skills, you also need to know about finance and banking as well as critical thinking and teamwork.</p><p>At present, I am a first-year college student whose major is Information Technology. Therefore, I do not have any qualifications for IT so far. Even so I have many experiences at coding with HTML, Python, CSS, and Java.</p><p>If I want to apply for this job with necessary skills. For programming languages such as Java, Python, HTML, and CSS, I must learn this within 5 years. For operating system like Linux or Window Server, besides learning at school, I will apply at some training courses. Finally, for the banking and finance skills, therefore I have study Management but still I must apply for some courses for 3 years as well.

<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
<br>
<p>Below here is a screenshot of 3 online test namely Myers-Briggs test, learning style test and the Big 5 Test:</p>

</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">These results show what is my personalities, my learning style and how do I behave in learning things. Furthermore, these results also tell that how do I achieve things with these personalities. In facts, even though that these results were given in detail but in my opinion, when working in a team, friendliness and talkative is the most important things despite what it is your personalities, hence this results will not have much influence to my behaviour in teamwork. If I am forming a team, these results will not be a thread for me and for other peoples.

<h2 align="center">Project Ideas</h2>
<hr color="black" width="20%">
<br>
<p align="justify">After thinking thoroughly, I have come up with an idea for my project. This was formed base on RMIT student’s problem such as the rate of students participate in events and club. Before settling to Sai Gon campus, I was studying at Hanoi campus. The difference between these two campuses is the participation and student’s relationship. Despite the low in number of students at Hanoi campus, therefore the bonds between students was incredibly strong. RMIT itself does not operate any events but in facts they let the student council or others club decide which events will be held at school. So, this project will be focused on how to strengthen the bond of students and make them be more active at school events.</p>
<p align="justify">As I have known, RMIT students use Messenger and Facebook as an intermediary to deliver announcement for upcoming events from student council or clubs. It seems that students must switch between these two applications consecutively, this action resulted in wasting more time or simply more annoying. This problem also occurs when you must go to Facebook to reply peoples who has comment on your post and then go back to Messenger to reply your club chat box or individuals for private chat. So, I have been thinking of making an app name ‘Let’s Connect’ as a solution for this problem.</p>
<p align="justify">‘Let’s Connect’ will be available on IOS and Android, the users which this project aim for is all students from every school but that’s the future goal, for now it just for RMIT students only. Similar to Canvas – a assignment announcement app, students have to use their school email to log in, if they instead using their own email rather than school email address, therefore they have to inform the name, school ID and RMIT code in order to participate in the forum. As I have mention above, these app will be accessible for other schools, so to provide privacy, students must type in the special code given by their school to log in, and each school will be display with clickable school icon so the users can distinguish easier. This quite like Facebook which is you must answer some question provide by the Page Headers and wait for they approvement to enter their community. When the students log in into their school forum a main page will shows up, every presenting or upcoming event will be displayed on this page followed by the date and time, on the head right corner there will be a menu icon for students to make a choice. The menu bar contains a magnifier icon for searching purposes such as events they want to see, a tent icon which refers to club, if students who have already joined a club this icon will ask they to type in the club name and lead to the chosen club forum, if that students have not joined any club so far and type in a club name, the systems will ask them to fill in the form, this form contain questions about the club and a time box where they choose date for the club interview. If they complete the form and click on the ‘Send’ button, this form will be delivered to the Club President and the participant will be informed the date and time for the interview that has been chose previously, there will be a mail icon at the top left corner to announce the users when there is a mail sent to them. When the students have been approved by the club president, their name will be listed in the club and they can be able to join the club forum. Furthermore, there is no limitation on applying for other clubs which will provide for the students more chance for achieving the approvement. When the user’s access to they club forum, there will be two option, the first one is for general group chat and the second one is for uploading the club events on the main page. When these new events were uploaded, and according on how many of them were published on the main page, the system will informed to all students in their school with a message such as “There are (number of events) new events, let’s take parts in these together!”, this announcement can be switch off on your phone setting.</p>
<p align="justify">‘Let’s Connect’ will be able to download on App Store and CH Play, which means is a mobile application. ‘Let’s Connect’ is free to download so what you need is a phone of your and get it from the store. Although ‘Let’s Connect’ is a mobile app downloaded from the phone specific store, therefore you can also access it from the Internet as well. If the user’s school is listed in the app, then the school itself should provide a website link which lead to ‘Lets Connect’ website. If they school does not have the website link, their can type in the app name on the searching engine such as Google, Bing or others to locate the website. Furthermore, there is no specific software, hardware or any relevant source tools that needed to access to ‘Let’s Connect’.
For this project, is just an idea of mine, but if I want to make this project, there are some necessary requirements. Coding is the most essential skill for completing this project. Firstly, for IOS, there are three languages program that need to learn, and use is Swift, C++ and Objective-C. You can choose 1 out of these 3 languages to write the program. These 3 language programs are free to download. According to Apple, if you use Objective-C you have to get used to it before starting to code with it, but for Swift is much more easier as it a combination of some of the best features from C++ and Objective. Secondly, for Android and website, the only programming language that available for Android is Java, and for the website we could code them by using Atoms or some relevant software. Finally, if you having difficult in learning these language, there a website called MIT App Inventor which let you create an app on the phone by yourself, you can also create the app by downloading it from the phone. So, it very easy to find and download the software, but it is very important to get used to it before developing an application.</p>
<p align="justify">If ‘Let’s Connect’ was completed, the bonds between RMIT students will be strengthen, and they will be more active at participating in school events and also joining clubs. Peoples besides acquiring knowledge, they will be making new friends as well, especially for new students. This project also helping the school to manipulate the information for the students. For example, some small events from other clubs never reach the students themselves because of other well-known events. So the impact that ‘Let’s Connect’ will help is to make all this events reach the students besides connecting the students together.</p>
